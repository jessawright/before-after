# Goal
This will be a before/after photo slider. There are a zillion of these around, but I want to make something particularly suited to comparing before and after photos from conservation treatments. Also, this is for learning, as I am new to front end web development.

# Development
* I intend this to be useable for other people, so I plan to write in vanilla Javascript and rely on straightforward semantic HTML/CSS.
* Since a lot of conservators use Wordpress to make their portfolio websites, I may try to make this a Wordpress plugin at some point. I don't know PHP or what all is involved in making a Wordpress plugin at this point, so that would be for a later time.
